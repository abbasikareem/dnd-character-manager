Overall design goal:
    Create a text-based D&D character manager that allows users to create new
    characters without having to pore over a game manual; track character 
    resources such as abilities, spells, inventory, and backstory; and
    simulate gameplay events like ability checks, saving throws, combat,
    spellcasting, and leveling up.

Organization:
    Spell class

    Item/Equipment class

        Weapon class

        Armor class

    Feature/Trait class

    Race class

    Background class

    Class class (might have to name HeroClass or PlayerClass or something)

    Effect class

    PlayerCharacter
    - Manages objects of every other type, along with other info (look to a 
    character sheet for reference)
    - Functions for leveling up, simulating combat, modifying inventory, etc.
